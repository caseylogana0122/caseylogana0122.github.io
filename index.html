    <p class="bio">I am a MA student at the University of Alabama studying Religion in Culture.<br><br>
    
        Before attending the University of Alabama, I graduated from the University of Rochester with a Honors BA in Religious Studies and a minor in Clinical Psychology. My honors thesis, Asherah's Decline: The Burning of Sacred Poles, was a diachronic analysis of the figure Asherah from the Late Bronze Age into the Early Iron Age. <br><br>
        
        My research interests involve understanding how religious worlds get constructed and how those words are interacted with. Much of my undergraduate work focused on studying Dante Alighieri and his Divine Comedy. <br><br>
        
        As I continue to grow in my scholarship, my focus at the University of Alabama is on The Book of Mormon and how it has changed throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. My hope is to digitally preserve this evolution by creating a program which will help me analyze textual differences between different Book of Mormon editions from 1837 to 2015.
